# Spotify
As part of our trainning we were given the challenge to make a clone of Spotify using HTML and CSS. The goal was to make it as close to what Spofity looked at that point in time but also make the website responsive when it comes to different screen resolutions.

I deployed this project using vercel, here you'll be able to see the hover effects and the responsivness live.
