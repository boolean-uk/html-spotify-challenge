# Spotify

At Boolean UK we were set a challenge to replicate Spotify. I used HTML, CSS to both look and perform as similar as possible with the abilities I had at that time. I am most proud of my implementation to allow website to be responsive on different screen resolutions very similar to Spotify's, also i inplemented on hover efects on the carda to display play button.

I have deployed the repo on vercel and it is available to view a live demo. I would really appreciate if you viewed the work I am so proud of and see it in action.

## Assesment Criteria

* &#9745; The overall structure of the layout reflects the `spotify-lg.png` reference image.
* &#9745; Fonts, colors and spacings used are similar (they don't need to be identical) to the reference images
* &#9745; CSS avoids repetition.
* &#9745; CSS class names are descriptive.
* &#9745; HTML is semantic and well structured.

### Extension Criteria

* &#9745; The left menu collapses as shown in `spotify-xs.png`.
* &#9745; The list of albums expands and collapses to fill the available page space (see `spotify-md.png` and `spotify-s.png`)
* &#9745; The top navigation list wraps as the page size is reduced.
* &#9745; On hovering over cover images, a play icon appears overlaid.
* &#9745; Only the main content area scrolls - it moves behind the upgrade bar and the player controls. The side menu also stays fixed as the main content scrolls.
